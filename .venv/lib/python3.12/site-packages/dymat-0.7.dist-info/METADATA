This package contains some modules to read and process the result files from
Dymola and OpenModelica with python. A script is included that will help you to
browse and export the contents of these files to other formats.

Both simulation systems save their results in regular mat-files, but use a
special variable structure to store the data efficiently. An easy way to
access the data is MATLAB, but some people (like me) don't have it or don't want
to use it.
